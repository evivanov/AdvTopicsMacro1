This version: December 25, 2008 (earlier versions: 2004, 2007)

The following items are provided: 

1. LICENSE AGREEMENT.

2. The article “Solving the Incomplete Markets Model with Aggregate 
   Uncertainty Using the Krusell-Smith Algorithm” by Lilia Maliar, 
   Serguei Maliar and Fernando Valli, (2010), Journal of Economic 
   Dynamics and Control 34, 42-49 (a working paper version). 

3. MATLAB FILES.

   a. "MAIN.m" computes a solution and stores the results in 
      "Solution";
   b. "SHOCKS.m" is a subroutine of MAIN.m generating the shocks;
   c. "INDIVIDUAL.m" is a subroutine of MAIN.m computing a solution 
       to the individual problem;
   d. "AGGREGATE_ST.m" is a subroutine of MAIN.m performing a 
       stochastic simulation;
   e. "AGGREGATE_NS.m" is a subroutine of MAIN.m performing a 
       non-stochastic simulation;
   f. "Inputs_for_test" contains initial distribution of capital and 
       10,000-period realizations of aggregate shock and idiosyncratic 
       shock for one agent provided in Den Haan, Judd and Juillard, 
       Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 2010, 34, pp. 1-3;
   g. "TEST.m" should be run after "MAIN.m"; it uses "Inputs_for_test" 
       and "Solution_to_model" for computing the statistics reported 
       in Den Haan's article, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 
       2010, 34, pp. 4-27.
